# Data files

[Original sources for fourth edition of book][source]

Though this links to the fourth edition of the book, the sample data (and source code for the most part) seems to line up pretty well with the first edition of the book that I'm working from. I have the original first edition along with the companion floppy disc which, naturally, does not work any more, so I haven't been able to retrieve the first edition files as of yet.
